# NeuronAgent Telegram Bot

NeuronAgent is a powerful Telegram bot built on `Aiogram 2`, providing AI-driven interactions by integrating `ChatGPT` and `Midjourney` through APIs. The bot enables users to purchase tokens for accessing GPT and Midjourney requests, leveraging multiple payment methods and a referral system to enhance engagement and provide flexible options for earnings. Backend and webhooks are implemented with `FastAPI`, and data is stored in a `PostgreSQL` database.
